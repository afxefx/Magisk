# Magisk

## How to build Magisk

#### Building has been tested on 3 major platforms: macOS, Ubuntu, Windows 10

### Environment Requirements

1. A 64-bit machine: `cmake` for Android is only available in 64-bit
2. Python 3.5+: run `build.py` script
3. Java Development Kit (JDK) 8: Compile Magisk Manager and sign zips
4. Latest Android SDK: `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable should point to the Android SDK folder
5. Latest Android NDK: Install NDK via `sdkmanager`, or via Android SDK Manager in Android Studio
6. (Windows Only) Colorama: Install Colorama with `pip install colorama`, used for ANSI color codes
7. (Unix only) C compiler: Build `zipadjust`. Windows users can use the pre-built `zipadjust.exe`

### Instructions and Notes

1. The easiest way to setup a working environment is to open Magisk Manager with Android Studio. The IDE will download required components and construct the environment for you. Don't forget to set `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the SDK path.
2. Run the script with `-h` as an argument to see the built-in help message. The `-h` option also works for each supported actions, e.g. `./build.py binary -h`
3. By default, the script will build binaries and Magisk Manager in debug mode. If you want to build Magisk Manager in release mode (through the flag `--release`), you will need to place your Java Keystore file at `release_signature.jks` to sign Magisk Manager's APK.
